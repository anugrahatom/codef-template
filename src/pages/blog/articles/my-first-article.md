Below are some frequently asked questions which you may find useful:

<p class="font-semibold">
1. Do you shoot destination weddings?
</p>
<p class="italic"> While I am based in Essex, i do offer an extensive range of services which includes shooting destination weddings. On my portfolio you can see that I recently travelled to Lithuania for an absolutely beautiful wedding. I would be more than happy to travel to photograph your special day. </p>

<p class="font-semibold">
2. What is the total price of the service you provide?
</p>
<p class="italic"> This entirely depends on the type of service to the length of service required. For example, a wedding will naturally cost more than a newborn photo-shoot, I can give more in-depth details regarding a price breakdown of the cost of my service through my email, noted in the Contact Us section. </p> 

<p class="font-semibold">
3. How long would it take you to deliver my photos?
</p>
<p class="italic"> Generally photos take 4-6 weeks to produce, edit and touch up (if required), but I ask for some leeway especially during the busy wedding season; April to August. If you require the photos earlier than the usual timeframe, please note that there may be an additional fee charged. </p>

<p class="font-semibold">
4. What is your cancellation/reschedulling policy?
</p>
<p class="italic"> If there is to be alast-minute cancellation, please note that there will be a last-minute cancellation fee due to the difficulty in rearrangements. The deposit paid is refundable but depending on the cancellation notice period, may only be viable for a partial refund. However, I can understand in emergencies and unforseeable circumstances hence I would recommend you notify us of any rearrangements as soon as possible, so as to find the next suitabe date as early as possible. </p>
